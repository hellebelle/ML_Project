# ML_Project
The goal of our project is to predict average housing prices over time to enable retail and institutional property buyers to better time their purchases so that their assets appreciate in value soon after buying them. 

Accurate forecasts of price movements are of great interest to any individual or institution with exposure to property prices and are usually a good barometer of the current economic cycle that the country itself is in since property is purchased using a combination of debt and income. Property price movements are primarily a  combination of the availability of debt and income as well as general economic health so we collected data that we felt was relevant to these factors.

Once we collected the data, we used ARMAX and VAR time series models to output our predicted value for average housing prices every month
